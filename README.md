# drlnd
This repository contains projects from 
Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.

To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, 
follow the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning):

Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

Linux or Mac:

```
conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
source activate drlnd
```

Windows:

```
conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
activate drlnd
```

Clone the repository and navigate to the python/ folder. Then, install several dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git  
cd deep-reinforcement-learning/python  
pip install .
```


Create an IPython kernel for the drlnd environment.

```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
```

Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the drlnd environment by using the drop-down Kernel menu.
